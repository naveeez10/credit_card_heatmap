# Credit Card Transactions Visualization Widget

## Overview

This Flutter project implements a widget to visualize credit card transactions over the past year. Inspired by GitHub's contribution graph, the widget displays a grid of blocks representing each day, with the color shade indicating the total amount spent. Users can click on any day's block to view detailed transactions for that day.

## Features

- **Daily Transaction Blocks**: Each block represents a day in the past year, color-coded based on spending levels.
- **Consolidated View**: Aggregates all transactions per day to show the total amount spent.
- **Interactivity**: Users can click on a specific day's block to view a list of transactions for that day.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility with various screen sizes.
- **Mock Data**: Uses mock transaction data for testing purposes.
